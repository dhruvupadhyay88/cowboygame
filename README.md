# Description
This is a game that i developed over the winter break as an introductory project to learning about the pygame module in python. 

This game is an obstacle dodging game where the user plays as a cowboy and must stay alive for as long as possible to get the highest score. The game keeps track of the score and saves a highscore locally. The player also loses a heart whenever the cowboy is hit and after all hearts are gone the game is over.

The cowboy's movements (idle, running, sliding) are animated by playing image sprites shortly after one another at 30 frames per second.
